					After dabbling in various Bitcoin-related ventures that have gone south in the past couple of years, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are betting on themselves by heading up the first regulated Bitcoin exchange
				</h1>
				<p>
					The Coinbase exchange will allow individuals and companies to do business in about half the states in the US where the company has regulatory approval. It will take a 0.25 percent cut of most transactions and waive fees for the first two months.
				</p>
				<p>
					Coinbase currently has 2.1 million consumer wallets and 38,000 merchants processing Bitcoin payments through its platform. The company received $75 million in funding.
